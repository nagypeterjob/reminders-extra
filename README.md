<h1 align="center">Reminders Extra</h1>
<p align="center">
    The application is an alternative for the built-in macOS Reminders application (altough intentionally not in feature parity.)
</p>

## What does it solve?
Even tough I like the iOS application, using Reminders on macOS is not convinient for me.
It isn't suited for quickly picking up todos during meetings or so.

## Technical details
I tried to use SwiftUI for everything for the better or worse.
You may download it from the Releases section: the application is signed and notarized.

## Features
